# Projects:
# FashionPal:

• The Fashion Pal project is a comprehensive online platform for dress shopping. It has the following features:
• Admin login: Admin can add new dresses and update the count whenever a new dress is bought or added
• Customer login: A customer can create or sign up for a new account or sign to an already existing account
• User Interface: Display all the dresses and show the count Make a list of your favorite dresses: Customers can add
  desired dresses to the cart
• Tools used: GitHub, npm, Jenkins, Docker, Ansible, ELK Stack (Elastic Search, Logstash, Kibana),Morgan Logger, Jest
• Used React and Node to build the website and used MongoDB as the database
• Deployed the app using the CI/CD pipeline in Jenkins.
• Github link to the project: https://github.com/AmulyaDebo/Fashion_Pal

# DDOS attack identification:
An imbalanced binary classification dataset was given to us, and we compared different ML algorithms to see which one
of them could act as an optimum classifier that can efficiently identify DDOS attack vs non-attack samples
